# What is this ?
This is a basic skeleton project for when you want to quick start
a java-springboot-maven project that is going to accept REST requests.

This repository is ready with a SampleController that has CRUD endpoints ready
and a sample Autowired Model.

All endpoints in the controller point to the same path (same mapping), and differ in the HTTP method type, 
path variables, response type and request object.

Basic unit testing is set up using Junit and Mockito

# Getting Started
- Fork/Clone this repository.
- Modify classes names to match your application intent.
- Modify/delete the endpoints names/methods/payload/variables to match your application intent.
- Add your Models or use the one already Autowired.
- Add validation and error handling if needed.
